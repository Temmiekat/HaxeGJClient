# Haxe GameJolt Client

Heya there! GamerPablito here!

Thanks for use this custom client for GameJolt for Haxe, this has very useful functions for different purposes with a little better performance than the default libraries (such as the flixel file ~~"FlxGameJolt"~~ or the original ~~"gamejoltAPI"~~ library stuff).

This was originally made for some Friday Night Funkin' mods, but it can be used for any game made using Haxe as well.

The purpose of this project is to make everything the best way possible, using less space and complexity for a better performance (and by that I mean it can be useful for computers with a very slow processing speed).

Hope this custom tool would come in handy to you :)

NOTE: Don't get confused with the GJ Integration made by [TentaRJ](https://github.com/TentaRJ/GameJolt-FNF-Integration)

## Special Features
- This client is totally independient, it doesn't requires any extra GameJolt libraries to work, cuz everything is written and composed here
- This also contains some files with info formats about how some data has to be received like, this in order to let the user know how to use the data in their game
- Has many extra features that can be fetched instantly without you have to code a lot for them
- Every file is full of instructions for each command, in order to do the things right if you don't know so much about it
